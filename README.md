# fasterLED
quickly generate code for the FastLED Arduino library

everything working except the semi-functional color picker. basically, the whole "gradient selector" is working, but if you input a color as hex, the gradient selector goes bananas and selects some random value.
app tested on firefox nightly and chromium.

this tool is still in development.
i am currently working on the colorpicker and animating :)

project completed in about 75%.
i will be more than happy to accept pr's with improvements and bug fixes
